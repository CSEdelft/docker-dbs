To restore and run a database use:

1. ```make run-nodb``` - to start without connecting to a database (database cannot be connected while restoring it)
2. ```make restore``` - restore db
3. ```make kill``` - shutdown database
4. At this point the database is restored and you can start it normally using ```make```
